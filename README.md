# DEG-Analysis-of-Undifferentiated-and-Differentiated-Human-ESC

+ As the final Project of Systems Biology course, we needed to implement a DEG analysis on a chosen dataset and showcase the results. 
+ We also been asked to do some enrichment analysis on DEGs using platforms like Enrichr and TRRUST.
+ In the final step we used Cytoscape and STRING to build ppi networks.
